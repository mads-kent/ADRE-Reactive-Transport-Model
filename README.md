# ADRE-Reactive-Transport-Model
This reactive transport model contains Julia code for the numerical simulation and optimization of a 2 phase mass transport and reaction process. The model simulates the addition of a treatment method (H2O2) in a bio clogged 1D porous media. The first phase simulates biofilm decay, while the second phase simulates growth.
